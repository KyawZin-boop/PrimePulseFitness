## Estimated Completion

- **2 features completed**: Dashboard, User Management
- **13 features remaining**
- **Estimated time per feature**: 30-45 minutes
- **Total remaining time**: ~8-10 hours of development

---

## Summary

The admin panel foundation is established with:
- âœ… Responsive layout and navigation
- âœ… Dashboard with key metrics
- âœ… User management with basic actions

To complete the full admin system, 12 additional feature views need to be created following the same patterns (mock data, TypeScript types, shadcn/ui components, toast notifications).

Would you like me to continue creating all remaining admin features, or would you prefer to focus on specific high-priority features first?
